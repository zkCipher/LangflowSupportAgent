# Langflow - Support Agent for Websites

This repository contains a tutorial and implementation for building a support agent for websites using Langflow, a low-code tool for developers. In this project, we integrate various AI models, external tools, and create an efficient AI-driven support system with minimal coding effort.

## Files

### `SupportAgent_Flow.json`
This file includes the complete flow for the support agent solution built using Langflow. It contains all the components, including AI models, tool integrations, and logic for handling user queries. You can import this JSON file into your Langflow workspace to quickly get started with the solution.

## Features
- Low-code approach to building AI workflows.
- Integration with OpenAI models and external tools like Tavily AI Search.
- Support agent designed to handle user queries, recommend suitable components, and provide helpful resources.
- Easy to deploy using Langflow API.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Import the `SupportAgent_Flow.json` file into your Langflow workspace.
3. Customize the flow as per your requirements (API keys, external tools, etc.).
4. Deploy the flow using Langflow API.

## Requirements
- Langflow account (sign up for free at [Langflow](https://www.langflow.com)).
- OpenAI API key for model integration.
- Tavily AI Search API key (for enhanced search functionality).

## Recommendations
Explore the Langwatch Evaluator component to assess the accuracy of generated responses against ground truth answers. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for improving the performance of your support agent.
